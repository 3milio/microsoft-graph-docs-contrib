# Working with the Azure AD entitlement management API

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entitlement management can help you manage access to groups, applications, and SharePoint Online sites for internal users as well as users outside your organization.

By creating access packages with the roles users need to have across those resources, and defining policies for who can request an access package and how long they can have an assignment to an access package, you can govern the lifecycle of access for both internal and external users.
