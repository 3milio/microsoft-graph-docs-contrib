The signed-in user must also be assigned one of the following [directory roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

+ Attribute Assignment Reader
+ Attribute Definition Reader
+ Attribute Assignment Administrator
+ Attribute Definition Administrator

By default, Global Administrator and other administrator roles do not have permissions to read, define, or assign custom security attributes.
