- Company Administrator
- Exchange Administrator
- SharePoint Administrator
- Lync Administrator
- Teams Service Administrator
- Teams Communications Administrator
- Global Reader
- Usage Summary Reports Reader
- Reports Reader

For more information, see [Authorization for APIs to read Microsoft 365 usage reports](/graph/reportroot-authorization).
