**Note**: For delegated permissions to allow apps to read service usage reports on behalf of a user, the tenant administrator must have assigned the user the appropriate Microsoft Entra ID limited administrator role. This can be one of the following roles:

- Company Administrator
- Exchange Administrator
- SharePoint Administrator
- Lync Administrator
- Teams Service Administrator
- Teams Communications Administrator
- Global Reader
- Usage Summary Reports Reader
- Reports Reader

The Global Reader and Usage Summary Reports Reader roles will only have access to tenant-level data, without visibility into detailed metrics. For more information, see [Authorization for APIs to read Microsoft 365 usage reports](/graph/reportroot-authorization).
