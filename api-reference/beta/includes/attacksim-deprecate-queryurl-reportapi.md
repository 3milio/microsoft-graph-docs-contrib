>[!CAUTION]
>The query endpoints for the **getAttackSimulationRepeatOffenders**, **getAttackSimulationSimulationUserCoverage**, and **getAttackSimulationTrainingUserCoverage** have changed. Make sure new apps and existing apps access these methods from the `http://graph.microsoft.com/beta/reports/security` endpoint and not the `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/reports/` endpoint. Those methods on the latter are deprecated as of July 15, 2022, and will stop returning data starting August 20, 2022.
