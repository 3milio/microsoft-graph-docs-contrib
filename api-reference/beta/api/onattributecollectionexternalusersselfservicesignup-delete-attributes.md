# Remove attribute (from user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Remove an attribute from an external identities self-service sign up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. You can add both custom and built-in attributes to a user flow.

This requires two calls â€“ a DELETE to remove the attribute followed by a PATCH to remove the attribute from the display during sign-up. **TODO: HOW TO REPRESENT BOTH CALLS?**
