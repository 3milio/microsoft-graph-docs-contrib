<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  "backgroundImage@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/backgroundImage",
  "backgroundImage@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/backgroundImage",
  "bannerLogo@odata.mediaContentType":"image/*",
  "bannerLogo@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/bannerLogo",
  "bannerLogo@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/bannerLogo",

  "signInPageText":"Default",
  "usernameHintText":"DefaultHint"
}
```

Requests for /branding always return the **mediaContentType**, **mediaReadLink**, and **mediaEditLink** properties. If a locale has been applied, the **mediaEditLink** is the **mediaEditLink** for the locale (which is always non-null), and the **mediaReadLink** and **mediaContentType** are the **mediaReadLink** and **mediaContentType** of the locale if the **mediaReadLink** of the locale is non-null; otherwise, the default **mediaReadLink** and **mediaContentType**.

### Example 2: Get organizational branding but no branding configured

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_organizationalbranding_3"
}-->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
```

### Example 3: Get organizational branding for the French locale
The Accept-Langauge header is used to apply a particular localization to the branding. Properties that are null in the specified localization are returned from the default branding. If the Accept-Language header is specified in the request, the response will include the Content-Language header, unless it is `und`.

#### Request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
