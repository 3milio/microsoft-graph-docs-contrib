# Create organizationalBrandingLocalization
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [organizationalBrandingLocalization](../resources/organizationalBrandingLocalization.md) object. This creates a localized branding and at the same time, the default branding if it doesn't exist.

The default branding is created only once. It's loaded when a localized branding isn't configured for the user's browser language. To retrieve the default branding, see [Get branding](organizationalbranding-get.md).

If no id is specified, then the value of the Content-Language header, if specified, is used as the id. If no id and no Content-Language header is specified, then an error is returned.

The **mediaEditLink** specifies where the localized media is written. The mediaReadLink is null because no media has been set for the localization.
