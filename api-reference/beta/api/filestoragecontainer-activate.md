# Activate fileStorageContainer
Namespace: microsoft.graph


Activate a fileStorageContainer. 

FileStorageContainers are created in an inactive state, indicated by the container's status property. A container must be activated in 24 hours after creation or will be automatically deleted. Upon successful activation, the container's status property is set to "active".

A fileStorageContainer can be activated by either calling the activate API, or calling any API that mutates the container or its content.

The application calling this API must have write permission to containers of the containerType the container belongs to.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
