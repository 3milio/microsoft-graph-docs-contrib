# Create connection

Namespace: microsoft.graph.externalConnectors

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /external/connections
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description                 |
|:--------------|:----------------------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.   |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and a new [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md) object in the response body.

>**Note:** When creating an external connection with a broken adaptive card for the result layout, the first call will fail with a `503 Service Unavailable`. Upon second try, the second call will fail with `409 Conflict` saying that the connection with the same name already exists. This happens because the connection was still created even though the first call failed with `503 Service Unavailable`. This is a [Known Issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=) we are tracking.
