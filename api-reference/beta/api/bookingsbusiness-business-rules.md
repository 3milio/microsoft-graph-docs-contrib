# Business rules validation

When an appointment is created by a non-administrator user, Microsoft Bookings will use the business rules which are configured for the Bookings calendar. However, administrators have the authority to override Bookings rules in a few cases.

In the case of a customer, either via graph APIs (using application permissions) or any other end point, the business rules must be respected or else there will be unforeseen errors.

<!-- When an appointment is created by a non-admin user, Bookings will use the business rules what the organization has configured for the Bookings calendar. However, admins can override these rules in certain circumstances. -->

## Business settings

### Business hours

The previous image shows a configuration option that can also be modified via API. Use the (API that can be used to modify businessHours) to modify **businessHours**. Note that an appointment can't be set outside the business hours.

### Scheduling policy

The image below shows the web-app settings. For more details about the scheduling policy, see [BookingSchedulingPolicy resource type](../../v1.0/resources/bookingschedulingpolicy.md).

**Time increments (Time slot interval)** indicates the duration of an appointment. While validating business rules, make sure that an appointment is for the same duration as indicated in the service.

**Minimum lead time** indicates the minimum time before an appointment can be made or cancelled.

**Maximum Lead time** indicates the maximum time before an appointment can be made.  

**Staff control (allow staff selection)** allows a customer to choose a specific person for their booking. If a user wants to pass staff members via the appointment API, they should set the **allowStaffSelection** attribute in [BookingSchedulingPolicy resource type](../../v1.0/resources/bookingschedulingpolicy.md) to true.

## Service level settings

### Scheduling

At a service, the scheduling policy is inherited from the business. The customer might choose to override the policies.

### Main policy  

If a scheduling policy exists at both service level and business level, the service level policy will take precedence.

### Partially set policies

If the user has set few of the 4 relevant policies and not all, we should inherit the unset policy from the business level scheduling policy. This wonâ€™t disrupt their functioning as they can set all the policies to the desired value for the service.

### Pre-Buffer

This is the extra time needed for an appointment before a following appointment. In the staff member calendar, the appointment is of duration "pre-buffer time" + "appointment slot time".

### Post-Buffer

This is the extra time needed for an appointment after a previous appointment. In the staff member calendar, the appointment is of duration "appointment slot time" + "post buffer time".
