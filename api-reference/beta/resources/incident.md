### m365AlertSeverity values 

| Member                     | Description                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unknown		     | Unknown severity.       |
| informational		 | Alerts that may not be actionable or considered harmful to the network but can drive organizational security awareness on potential security issues.     |
| low                | Alerts on threats associated with prevalent malware. For example, hack-tools, non-malware hack tools, such as running exploration commands and clearing logs, that often don't indicate an advanced threat that targets the organization. It can also come from an isolated security tool that is tested by a user in your organization.  |
| medium             | Alerts generated from detections and response post-breach behaviors that might be a part of an advanced persistent threat (APT). This includes observed behaviors typical of attack stages, anomalous registry change, execution of suspicious files, and so forth. Although some might be due to internal security testing, they are valid detections and require investigation as they may be a part of an advanced attack. |
| high               | Alerts commonly seen associated with advanced persistent threats (APT). These alerts indicate a high risk because of the severity of damage they can inflict on assets. Some examples are: credential theft tools activities, ransomware activities not associated with any group, tampering with security sensors, or any malicious activities indicative of a human adversary. |
| unknownFutureValue | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Do not use. |
