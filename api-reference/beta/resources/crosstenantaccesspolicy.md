# crossTenantAccessPolicy resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Cross-tenant access settings let you control and manage collaboration between users in your organization and other organizations. This collaboration is mainly through the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2B and Azure AD B2B Direct Connect (future) features. The control can be on either **outbound access** (how your users collaborate with other organizations), **inbound access** (how other organizations collaborate with you), or both.

Granular controls let you determine the people, groups, and apps, both in your organization and in external organizations, that can participate in Azure AD B2B and Azure AD B2B Direct Connect collaboration. These controls are implemented through:

+ **Default cross-tenant access settings** which set the baseline inbound and outbound access settings.
    + In Azure AD B2B collaboration, both access settings are enabled by default. This means all your users can be invited to external organizations, and all your users can invite external users.
    + In Azure AD B2B Direct Connect, both access settings are disabled by default.
+ **Partner-specific access settings** which allow you to configure customized settings for individual organizations. For the configured organizations, this configuration takes precedence over the default settings. Therefore, while Azure AD B2B and Azure AD B2B Direct Connect might be disabled across your organization by default, you can enable these features for a specific external organization.
