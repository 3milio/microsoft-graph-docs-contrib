# Use the Microsoft Search API to manage administrative answers

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

You can use Microsoft Graph to manage administrative search answer results in the [Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search) experience.

Requests to manage administrative search answers are performed by global administrators, search administrators, search editors, or are performed on behalf of an application without the presence of a signed-in user, identified using an [access token with application permission](/graph/auth-v2-service).

## Common use cases

The use cases for the APIs in this section involve managing administrative answers such as acronyms, bookmarks, and QnAs for an organization.
