# CSP Partner Security Alerts API overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph.partner.security

As a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, you are responsible for your customer's Azure consumption, so it is important that you are aware of any anomalous usage in your customer's Azure subscriptions. Use Microsoft Graph [partner security alerts](../resources/partner.security-partnersecurityalert.md) to detect patterns of fraudulent activities and misuse in Azure resources to help reduce your exposure to online transaction risks.
