# Use the Windows settings API in Microsoft Graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The Windows setting API enables users and authorized third parties acting on behalf of users to retrieve their Windows operating system settings data stored in the Microsoft cloud. The Windows settings data is available in the Microsoft cloud only when users activate the feature. The scope of data available for each user depends on their backup settings selections. The default values for any settings remain local and aren't transferred to the cloud. The Windows settings API only shares settings data that the user uploads to the cloud.

## Windows settings

A [**windowsSetting**](../resources/windowssetting.md) represents various settings from the Windows operating system that are stored in the cloud for a given user.

There are two types of [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md): `roaming` and `backup`. The *settingType* property of a [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) object indicates the type of the setting.

| settingType        | Description                        |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| roaming            | The Windows setting is associated with a user's account. It's consistent across all devices and any changes to the setting value are synced or applied to all Windows devices that the user owns.|
| backup             | The Windows setting doesn't roam or sync across devices. This type of setting is used in device backup and restore scenarios.|

 A [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) of type `backup` may have a *windowsDeviceId* property that links the setting to a specific device.

 The [List Windows settings](../api/usersettings-list-windows.md) API returns a collection of [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) objects and their properties. You can filter the results by *windowsDeviceId* and *settingType* properties.

The [Get Windows setting](../api/windowssetting-get.md) API allows you to pass the ID of a [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) in the URL to read a specific Windows setting object.

The following JSON representation shows an example of a Windows setting. The instances collection in it represents **Windows setting instances**, elaborated in the next section.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "resource",
  "keyProperty": "id",
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.windowsSetting",
  "baseType": "microsoft.graph.entity",

                "expirationDateTime": "2034-02-09T19:34:33.771Z"
            }
        ]
}
```

> Warning:<br />The structure of the ID of a [**windowsSetting**](../resources/windowssetting.md) is not guaranteed and the caller should not take any dependency on it. The ID should be treated as an opaque string.

## Windows setting instances

A [**windowsSettingInstance**](../resources/windowssettinginstance.md) represents a setting instance from the Windows operating system that is stored in the cloud for a given user. A [windowsSettingInstance](../resources/windowssettinginstance.md) belongs to a [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md).

The following JSON representation shows an example of a Windows setting instance.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "resource",
  "keyProperty": "id",
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.windowsSettingInstance",
  "baseType": "microsoft.graph.entity",
  "openType": false
}
-->
``` json
{
  "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.windowsSettingInstance",
  "id": "6984732f-86b0-8e31-dc02-37fce0df6d61",
  "payload": "VGhpcyBpcyBhbm90aGVyIGp1c3QgYW4gZXhhbXBsZSE=",
  "lastModifiedDateTime": "2024-10-31T23:30:41Z",
  "createdDateTime": "2024-02-12T19:34:35.223Z",
  "expirationDateTime": "2034-02-09T19:34:33.771Z"
}
```

The [List Windows setting instances](../api/windowssetting-list-instances.md) API returns a collection of [windowsSettingInstance](../resources/windowssettinginstance.md) objects and their properties. The API requires the ID of a [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) in the URL to read the setting instances.

The [Get Windows setting instance](../api/windowssettinginstance-get.md) API allows you to pass the ID of a [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) and [windowsSettingInstance](../resources/windowssettinginstance.md) in the URL to read a specific windows setting instance object.

The *payload* property of a [**windowsSettingInstance**](../resources/windowssettinginstance.md) contains the actual setting value. The *payload* is a string in Base64 encoded format. The *payloadType* property of the [**windowsSetting**](../resources/windowssetting.md) object indicates the type of the setting value. The *payload* when decoded is a JSON object, which differs from setting to setting and is specific to the *payloadType*.

## About the *payloadType* property
The *payloadType* defines the structure of a [windowsSettingInstance](./windowssettinginstance.md) payload. There are numerous payloadTypes in Windows, which represent distinct setting structures used by different experiences in the operating system. As Windows evolves, more payloadTypes are created and onboarded to the cloud. Querying the API and exploring the settings available is the best way to learn about the various payloadTypes. The users and admins have control over which settings are uploaded to the cloud and most components don't upload default settings that the user hasn't customized.

the following example shows a settingsInstance from the API.

```json
{
    "id": "default$windows.data.fileexplorerclassic.advancedsettings",
    "settingType": "roaming",
    "payloadType": "windows.data.fileexplorerclassic.advancedsettings",
    "instances": [
        {
            "id": "d9a7f6e2-8c4b-4e3a-bf7c-1e5a9d8c6f4b",
            "payload": "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",
            "lastModifiedDateTime": "2022-06-27T00:53:00Z",
            "createdDateTime": "2024-02-13T19:51:15.8217101Z",
            "expirationDateTime": "2034-02-10T19:51:14.813Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, the payloadType `windows.data.fileexplorerclassic.advancedsettings` represents some of the settings that the File Explorer backs up to the cloud. The Base64 payload can be decoded to a UTF-8 string to see the JSON representation of this object.

**Payload decoded:**
```json
{
    "migratedFromSSF": false,
    "alwaysShowMenus": false,
    "folderContentsInfoTip": false,
    "hideDrivesWithNoMedia": false,
    "navPaneExpandToCurrentFolder": false,
    "navPaneShowAllFolders": false,
    "navPaneShowFavorites": false,
    "persistBrowsers": false,
    "sharingWizardOn": false,
    "showDriveLetters": false,
    "showPreviewHandlers": false,
    "typeAhead": false,
    "showStatusBar": false,
    "showLibraries": false,
    "showCompColor": false
}
```

It's common for the properties in the object to be a subset of those that are available in the componentâ€™s user experience as component owners decide which settings provide the most value when uploaded to the cloud.

### PayloadTypes of particular interest

Some payloadTypes have a special role in the Windows settings backup process.

#### windows.data.platform.backuprestore.deviceprofile 
Rather than being a setting the user has applied, this type records information about devices that have opted into settings backup features. Two properties in this object are useful for understanding the rest of the settings: *deviceDisplayName* and *profileId*. 

- *deviceDisplayName* is the name of the computer, which can be seen in Windows system settings at "**Start** > **Settings** > **System**".
- *profileId* is an identifier used to link [**windowsSetting**](../resources/windowssetting.md) items to the device that uploaded them. This property corresponds to **windowsSetting.windowsDeviceId** and can be used as a filter to get settings for a specific device from [List Windows settings](../api/usersettings-list-windows.md) API.

The following example shows this resource type.

```json
{
    "id": "default$windows.data.platform.backuprestore.deviceprofile$deviceprofiles",
    "settingType": "backup",
    "payloadType": "windows.data.platform.backuprestore.deviceprofile",
    "instances": [
        {
            "id": "73b1a0b8-262a-4804-592a-b82a3a2a0c0d",
            "payload": "ewogICAgInByb2ZpbGVJZCI6ICJ7OTViM2EyYzgtNDgyYS00YTA2LTdiM2EtZGEyYTVhNGIyYzBmfSIsCiAgICAiZGV2aWNlRGlzcGxheU5hbWUiOiAiRVhBTVBMRVVTRVJERVNLVE9QIiwKICAgICJjcmVhdGVkQnkiOiAid2luZG93cyIsCiAgICAic291cmNlUHJvZmlsZUlkIjogIiIsCiAgICAiY3JlYXRlZFRpbWUiOiAxNjY0NjgwNTg5LAogICAgIm1vZGlmaWVkVGltZSI6IDE2OTg3OTUwNDAsCiAgICAiaXNBY3RpdmUiOiB0cnVlLAogICAgImxhc3RGdWxsQmFja3VwQ29tcGxldGVkVGltZSI6IDE2OTgzMzIxMzcsCiAgICAib3NWZXJzaW9uIjogIjE4MDQ1LjM3NTAudmJfcmVsZWFzZSIKfQ==",
            "lastModifiedDateTime": "2023-10-31T23:30:40Z",
            "createdDateTime": "2024-02-13T22:49:02.376Z",
            "expirationDateTime": "2034-02-10T22:49:03.365Z"
        }
    ]
}
```
**Payload decoded:**

```json
{
    "profileId": "{95b3a2c8-482a-4a06-7b3a-da2a5a4b2c0f}",
    "deviceDisplayName": "EXAMPLEUSERDESKTOP",
    "createdBy": "windows",
    "sourceProfileId": "",
    "createdTime": 1664680589,
    "modifiedTime": 1698795040,
    "isActive": true,
    "lastFullBackupCompletedTime": 1698332137,
    "osVersion": "18045.3750.vb_release"
}
```

#### windows.data.platform.settingsbackup.backupunitstore

The **backupUnitStore** payloadType settings are unique in that the actual settings value is a **blob** in the data property. This is because **backupUnitStore** settings are collected directly from the Windows registry, on disk files, or other at rest locations throughout Windows. These settings weren't designed to be interoperable with experiences besides the components that created them. However, they have been included in this API for comprehensive coverage of all Windows settings that are stored in the cloud.
