# Use the Microsoft Graph compliance API

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The Microsoft Graph compliance API provides a unified interface and schema to integrate with compliance solutions from Microsoft and ecosystem partners. This can help customers streamline their compliance operations to better manage and monitor their data, protect information, minimize insider risk, perform legal and internal investigations, and comply with legal or regulatory standards. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 compliance documentation](/microsoft-365/compliance).

Use the Microsoft Graph compliance API to build applications that:

- Automate common tasks in eDiscovery

- Create and manage subject rights requests

The Microsoft Graph compliance API includes the following key entities.

## eDiscovery

eDiscovery in Microsoft 365 provides an end-to-end workflow to preserve, collect, review, analyze, and export data that's responsive to your organization's internal and external investigations. Learn more about [Microsoft 365 Advanced eDiscovery](/microsoft-365/compliance/overview-ediscovery-20).

## Subject Rights Request

Privacy management provides powerful subject rights requests capabilities to help you handle requests from people seeking to manage their personal data within your organization. These requests are sometimes also referred to as data subject requests (DSRs), data subject access requests (DSARs), or consumer rights requests. Privacy management empowers personnel responsible for fulfilling subject rights requests to easily identify data subjects and find their personal information among your organizationâ€™s data in Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. Learn more about [Microsoft 365 Subject Rights Requests](/microsoft-365/compliance/privacy-management-subject-rights-requests).
