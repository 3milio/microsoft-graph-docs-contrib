# windowsSettingInstance resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

**windowsSettingInstance** represents setting instances from Windows operating system that are stored in the cloud for a given user.

A **windowsSettingInstance** belongs to a [**windowsSetting**](../resources/windowssetting.md) and represents a specific setting value for a given user. 

The *payload* property of a **windowsSettingInstance** contains the actual setting value. The *payload* is a string in base64 encoded format. The *payloadType* property of the [**windowsSetting**](../resources/windowssetting.md) object indicates the type of the setting value. The *payload* when decoded is a JSON object which differs from setting to setting and is specific to the *payloadType*.


Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).
