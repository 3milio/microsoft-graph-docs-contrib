# Use the Microsoft Graph Data Subject Request API

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In accordance with certain privacy regulations around the world, individuals may make requests to review or manage the personal data about themselves that companies have collected. We refer to these requests as subject rights requests within the Microsoft 365 privacy management solution: These requests are sometimes also referred to as data subject requests (DSRs) or data subject access requests (DSARs). Microsoft 365 privacy management empowers personnel responsible for fulfilling subject rights requests to easily identify data subjects and find their personal information among your organizationâ€™s data in Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. 

The Microsoft Graph APIs for Data subject request provide functionality for organizations to automate repetitive tasks and integrate with existing data subject request tools, to enable building repeatable workflows that can be incorporated to their business processes. You can use the data subject request APIs to help you automate and scale your organization's ability to perform subject rights requests searches in Microsoft 365 and help meet industry regulations more efficiently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Graph APIs for data subject request are intended to help meet the needs of fulfilling subject rights requests within Microsoft 365 services for Exchange online, SharePoint online, Teams chats, and OneDrive for Business. These APIs should not be used as a substitute for searching for data in any other Microsoft 365 system or any other area not explicity supported.

> [!NOTE]
> During the preview, usage of these APIs may require subscriptions to specific Microsoft offerings and is subject to the [Microsoft APIs Terms of Use](/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use?context=graph%252fcontext).  Upon general availability, Microsoft may require you or your customer to pay additional fees.
