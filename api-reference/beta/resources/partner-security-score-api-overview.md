# Use the partner security score API in Microsoft Graph (preview)

Namespace: microsoft.graph.partner.security

In the Microsoft Partner Center ecosystem, we provide a security score to Indirect Provider or Direct Bill Partners partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), Value Added Reseller, or Advisor programs who are . The goal of the score and requirements is to help partners understand the security posture of their tenant and their customer's tenants. The partner security score builds on the Identity and Microsoft 365 security scores to provide specific suggestions to their scenario.
The [Partner Security Score API](../resources/partner-security-partnersecurityscore.md) is a pivotal tool designed to empower Microsoft partners by providing a quantifiable measure of their security performance. This API facilitates partners in enhancing their security posture by offering a comprehensive security score based on their adherence to Microsoft's security requirements.

* __Guiding Security Enhancements with Actionable Insights:__ Providing actionable insights and recommendations to help partners bolster their security measures.  
* __Monitoring Security Evolution:__ Enabling partners to track their security improvements over time, fostering a culture of continuous security enhancement.
