# Get change notifications delivered through webhooks

Your app can receive Microsoft Graph change notifications through **webhooks**.

A webhook is a HTTP-based user-defined callback API that you can set up in your infrastructure to receive change notifications and events from a service, such as Microsoft Graph. You must configure the webhook using a well-known and accessible HTTPS-secured endpoint.

To receive change notifications through webhooks, you need to create a subscription to the resource for which you want to be notified of changes. While the subscription is active, Microsoft Graph will send a notification to your app whenever a change is detected on the resource.

This document walks you through receiving change notifications for Microsoft Graph resources through webhooks.

## Create a subscription

The first step to start receiving change notifications for a resource is to create a subscription through the **subscription** resource type. The subscription process is as follows:

1. The client app sends a subscription request to subscribe to changes on a specific resource.

1. Microsoft Graph verifies the request.

    - If the request is valid, Microsoft Graph sends a validation token to the notification URL.
    - If the request is invalid, Microsoft Graph sends an error response with an error code and details.

1. The client sends the validation token back to Microsoft Graph.

1. Microsoft Graph sends a response back to the client with a valid subscription ID. The client now has a valid subscription.

The client must store the subscription ID to correlate change notifications with the subscription.

### Subscription request

In the following example, your app creates a subscription to subscribe to changes to a specific mail folder on behalf of the signed-in user.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "change-notifications-subscriptions-example"
}-->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/notificationClient",
  "resource": "/me/mailfolders('inbox')/messages",
  "expirationDateTime": "2016-03-20T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "SecretClientState"
}
```

While **clientState** is not required, you must include it to comply with our recommended change notification handling process. Setting this property will allow you to confirm that change notifications you receive originate from the Microsoft Graph service. For this reason, the value of the property should remain secret and known only to your application and the Microsoft Graph service.

<!-- Q: If I don't include clientState, will the request fail?-->

If successful, Microsoft Graph returns a `201 Created` code and a [subscription](/graph/api/resources/subscription) object in the body.

Each subscription has a unique subscriptionId, even if you have multiple subscriptions that monitor the same resource and use the same notification URL.

> [!NOTE]
> Any query string parameter included in the **notificationUrl** property will be included in the HTTP POST request when notifications are being delivered to your service.

<!-- Q: Is notificationUrl validation specific to subscriptions through webhooks -->

## Renew a subscription

Subscriptions are not perpetual but have lifetimes.

The client can renew a subscription with a specific expiration date of up to three days from the time of request. The `expirationDateTime` property is required. <!-- Clarification: I thought it all depends on https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/subscription?view=graph-rest-1.0&branch=pr-en-us-20024#maximum-length-of-subscription-per-resource-type-->

### Subscription renewal request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "change-notifications-subscriptions-example-renewal"
}-->
```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "expirationDateTime": "2016-03-22T11:00:00.0000000Z"
}
```

If the request is successful, Microsoft Graph returns a `200 OK` response code and a [subscription](/graph/api/resources/subscription) object in the response body. The subscription object includes the new `expirationDateTime` value.

<!--  what happens if you don't renew? Does Microsoft Graph automatically delete the subscription?-->

## Delete a subscription

The client can stop receiving change notifications by deleting the subscription using its ID.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "change-notifications-subscriptions-example-delete"
}-->
```http
DELETE https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions/{id}
```

If successful, Microsoft Graph returns a `204 No Content` code.

## Receive notifications

While the subscription is active and the resource changes, Microsoft Graph sends a `POST` request to the notification URL with notifications of changes that the app subscribed to. This is the **change notification**.

A change notification received by your app can contain a collection change notifications relating to multiple subscriptions.

<!-- Is the preceding line technically accurate?
>> [!NOTE]
> If a client has multiple subscriptions , Microsoft Graph can send multiple change notifications that correspond to different subscriptions, each showing the corresponding subscription ID. There is no guarantee that all change notifications in the `POST` request belong to a single subscription.
-->

### Change notification example

This section shows an example of a notification for a message creation. When the user receives an email, Microsoft Graph sends a change notification object to the app as shown in the following example. See [changeNotificationCollection](/graph/api/resources/changenotificationcollection) for details of the notification payload.

When many changes occur, Microsoft Graph may send multiple notifications that correspond to different subscriptions in the same `POST` request.

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "lsgTZMr9KwAAA",
      "subscriptionId":"{subscription_guid}",
      "subscriptionExpirationDateTime":"2016-03-19T22:11:09.952Z",
      "clientState":"secretClientValue",
      "changeType":"created",
      "resource":"users/{user_guid}@{tenant_guid}/messages/{long_id_string}",
      "tenantId": "84bd8158-6d4d-4958-8b9f-9d6445542f95",
      "resourceData":
      {
        "@odata.type":"#Microsoft.Graph.Message",
        "@odata.id":"Users/{user_guid}@{tenant_guid}/Messages/{long_id_string}",
        "@odata.etag":"W/\"CQAAABYAAADkrWGo7bouTKlsgTZMr9KwAAAUWRHf\"",
        "id":"{long_id_string}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Processing the change notification

Your service should process every change notification it receives. The following are the minimum tasks that your app must perform to process a change notification:

1. Your process should process every change notification it receives and send a 2xx class code back to Microsoft Graph. If Microsoft Graph doesn't receive a 2xx class code within 3 seconds, it will try to publish the change notification a number of times, for a period of about 4 hours; after that, the change notification will be discarded and won't be delivered. If your process consistently does not respond within 3 seconds, your notification might be subject to throttling.

    If your processing is expected to take more than 3 seconds, you should persist the notification, return a `202 - Accepted` status code in your response to Microsoft Graph, then process the notifications at your capacity. If the notification is not persisted, return a 5xx class code to indicate an error so that Microsoft Graph can retry the notification.

    If your processing is expected to take less than 3 seconds, you should process the notifications and return a `200 - OK` status code in your response to Microsoft Graph. If the notification is not processed correctly, return a 5xx class code to indicate an error so that Microsoft Graph can retry the notification.

1. Validate the `clientState` property. It must match the value originally submitted with the subscription creation request.

    If there's a mismatch, do not consider the change notification as valid. It is possible that the change notification has not originated from Microsoft Graph and may have been sent by a rogue actor. You should also investigate where the change notification comes from and take appropriate action.

1. Update your application based on your business logic.
