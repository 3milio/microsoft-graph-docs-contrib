# Best practices for using Microsoft Teams activity feed notifications

This article covers best practices for using Microsoft Teams activity feed notifications in Microsoft Graph. These best practices apply to:
* Creating call-to-action notifications
* Requesting responses to notifications
* Creating notifications about external events

When you implement activity feed notifications, keep the following points in mind:
* Toast notifications redirect users to the activity feed, not to the app. To see another activity, users must select the associated notification in the activity feed.
* Users can manage notification settings only after the selected app sends a notification.
* The icon for each notification is included in the app manifest. Microsoft Graph does not support customizing it.
* Priority notifications are not supported.
* Localize the content in a notification toast or feed. The localization happens only if the appâ€™s content is [localized](/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization).
* Provide appropriate titles and descriptions for your **Activity Types**. Use short titles, such as **@mention** and **Announcements**. Avoid long titles, such as **User at-mentioned activity** and **Post creation activity**.

The following image depicts appropriate titles:

The following image shows long titles, which are not suggested to use:

* Notifications should convey important information for the user. For example: Lynne mentioned you in a conversation.
* Avoid sending notifications that are promotional in nature. For example: Try the new feature in the Cycling app!
* Inform the user about the notifications storage period in the activity feed. In Microsoft Teams, the storage period is 30 days.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The 30 day storage limit applies to all notifications. It's not specific to notifications sent through the activity feed notifications API.

## Enhance the notification experience

Microsoft Teams displays notifications in both activity feed and toast formats. Users receive notifications from multiple sources across chats, channels, meetings, or other apps. To simplify the user experience, apply the following recommendations:

* Send notifications that are directly relevant to the users. For example, "Diego assigned a sales ticket to you" is a relevant message; "Joni left the sales team" is not a relevant message.
* Avoid duplicate notifications from bot messages and activity feed notifications. For more information, see [activity feed notifications or bot framework messages](#activity-feed-notifications-or-bot-framework-messages).
* Use the **Text Preview section** in notifications. Provide information to help the user determine the importance of the notification and take action, if necessary.
* Don't add a period at the end of the notification title to be consistent with with all other notification settings in Teams.
* Make the relationship between the notification and its content clear to the user. For example, when a user receives a notification for approving a leave, the notification should redirect them to the corresponding section of the app. If the notification pertains to removal or deletion of entities, such as users and tasks, direct the recipient to the content and indicate the required action.
* Make sure that the feed experience is self-contained. For example, any pop-ups and modals must remain in the app.
* Verify that your app does not send more than 10 notifications per minute, per user. Notifications will be automatically throttled if the count exceeds 10.
* Ensure that the load time of your app does not negatively affect the experience for users when they switch between notifications in the feed.

### Activity feed notifications or bot framework messages

Use the type of notifications based on need. The following section helps you to select the required type of notification as per functionality and usage. Don't use both types of notifications, you can either use activity feed notifications or bot framework messages to notify users. 

#### Activity feed notifications

The activity feed notifications land in the activity feed and can include links to various locations. These notifications help you with the following: 
* Allow the user to take action or triage the notification.
* Lead the user to a tab in a chat or channel, a personal app, or a chat or channel message. 

These notifications address users, not channels, unless the nofication includes a mention to a channel. 

The activity feed notifications API allows users to configure notifications for each **Notification type** from the app. The capability to configure, allows the user to customize a notification. 

Users could receive double notifications from the app. The app can send bot notifications to chats or channels and also to activity feed notifications API. *Send double notifications only if the scenario requires you to send them.* 

The activity feed notification API can send either delegated or application-only calls. In delegated calls, the sender of the notification appears as the user who initiated the notification, for example, *John Doe*, and in application-only the sender appears as the app, for example, *Contoso*. 

You can update an existing activity feed notification instead of creating a new notification by using the `chainId` parameter.

#### Bot framework messages

Bot messages are delivered as chat or channel messages. If the users' notifications for chat or channel are turned on, they trigger notifications as chat or channel notifications:

* *@mention* the name of the user for the notification to appear in the activity feed.
* It is useful if the alert is consumed as a chat or channel message or is consumed broadly. For example, message is consumed by all channel members.
