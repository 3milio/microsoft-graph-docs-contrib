# Use the Microsoft Search API to search people (preview)

Microsoft Graph applications can use the People API to retrieve the people who are most relevant to a user. Relevance is determined by the user’s communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships. People can be local contacts or from an organization’s directory, and people from recent communications. Along with generating this insight, the People API also provides fuzzy matching search support and the ability to retrieve the list of users relevant to another user in the signed-in user's organization. The People API is particularly useful for people picking scenarios, such as composing an email or creating a meeting. For example, you can use the People API in email compose scenarios.

## Example 1: Search messages in a user's mailbox

The following request gets the people most relevant to the signed-in user, based on communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships.

### Request

```HTTP
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/search/query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "requests": [
    {
      "entityTypes": [
        "people"
      ],
      "query": {
        "queryString": "contoso"
      },
      "from": 0,
      "size": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response

The following is an example of the response, which contains one message that matches the search criterion.

## Known limitations

- You can access only the signed-in user’s own mailbox. Searching delegated mailboxes is not supported.
- For messages, the **total** property of the [searchHitsContainer](/graph/api/resources/searchhitscontainer) type contains the number of results on the page, not the total number of matching results.
- Sorting results is not supported for events. A sort clause in the request will return a Bad Request error code in the response.

## Next steps

- [Use the Microsoft Search API](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview)
