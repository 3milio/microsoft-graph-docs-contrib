# States, transitions, and limitations for submissions in Microsoft Graph

Submissions are an important part in the interaction between teachers and students' actions. This article describes the changes in the submission states during the process flow and which education APIs in Microsoft Graph are involved.

## Submission states and transitions

A submission represents the resources that an individual (or group) turns in for an assignment. Submissions are owned by an assignment and are automatically created when an assignment is published.

The status is a read-only property in the submission and changes based on the actions of students and teachers.

| State | Description | REST API call |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Working |	Initial state after the submission is created. | `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments`<br/>`POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/unsubmit` |
| Submitted	| It happens after the student turned in the assignment. | `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/submit` |
| Returned | After the teacher returned the assignment back to the student. | `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/return` |
| Reassigned | After the teacher returned the assignment  to the student for revision. | `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/reassign` |

The following diagram shows the state transition flow.

### Submission state transitions based on allowed actions

| Current submission state | New action | New state |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Working |	Turn in	| Submitted |
| Working |	Return for revision	| Reassigned |
| Working |	Return | Returned |
| Submitted	| Undo Turn in | Working |
| Submitted | Return | Returned |
| Submitted | Return for revision | Reassigned |
| Returned | Turn in | Submitted |
| Returned | Return | Returned |
| Returned | Return for revision | Reassigned |
| Reassigned | Turn in | Submitted |
| Reassigned | Return | Returned |
| Reassigned | Return for revision | Reassigned |

> [!NOTE]
> Any action and state transition not listed in the table is not allowed.

### Sync vs. async operations over submissions API calls

The following table lists the API calls that affect the submission state and the operation type.

In this case, all the calls are asynchronous, which means that the operation starts and another operation can start before the first one finishes. The asynchronous operation performs some background activity, and the caller must be polling to get the result.  

| API | Sync or async | Mechanism to get latest state |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/submit` | Async | Poll |
| `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/unsubmit` | Async | Poll |
| `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/return` | Async | Poll |
| `POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/reassign` | Async | Poll |

### Limits

The following limits apply to all API calls:

* The maximum number of assignments and submissions resources are 10 for the teacher and plus 10 for the student.
* The maximum size allowed for resources is 50 MB overall or 10 resources.
* Throttling limits apply; for details, see [Microsoft Graph throttling guidance](/graph/throttling).
