# Enabling or disabling pronouns settings in Microsoft 365 (preview)

If you are a global administrator, you have the ability to enable or disable the display of pronouns in your organization. By default, pronouns are **disabled**. If you enable pronouns, users will be able to add and update pronouns in Microsoft apps and services.

> [!NOTE]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

## Confirm your current settings

Use the [get](/graph/api/pronounssettings-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) operation to return the current configuration of pronouns in your organization.

In this example, pronouns are disabled: 

``` http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/{organizationId}/settings/pronouns
```

If successful, the response returns a `200 OK` response code and a [**pronounsSettings**](/graph/resources/pronounssettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) object in the response body.

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "value": {
    "isEnabledInOrganization": false
  }
}
```
â€ƒ
## Scenarios

You can either make pronouns available or unavailable in Microsoft apps and services in your organization.

|Scenario | isEnabledInOrganization|
|:---|:---|
|Make pronouns unavailable to everyone in the organization (default) | False|
|Make pronouns available to everyone in the organization. | True|


## Enabling pronouns in your organization

Use the [patch](/graph/api/pronounssettings-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) operation to allow showing pronouns in Microsoft apps and services in your organization.

``` http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/{organizationId}/settings/pronouns
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isEnabledInOrganization": true
}
```
If successful, the response returns a `200 OK` response code and a [**pronounsSettings**](/graph/resources/pronounssettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) object in the response body.

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isEnabledInOrganization": true
}
```

## Disabling pronouns in your organization

Use the `patch` operation to make pronouns unavailable in Microsoft apps and services in your organization.

``` http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/{organizationId}/settings/pronouns
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isEnabledInOrganization": false
}
```

If successful, the response returns a `200 OK` response code and a [**pronounsSettings**](/graph/resources/pronounssettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) object in the response body.

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isEnabledInOrganization": false
}
```

## Important

When pronouns are turned off in your organization, pronouns will be hidden in Microsoft apps. However, the data may persist on Microsoft servers for up to 30 days. If you decide to re-enable pronouns within that period, any previously hidden pronouns that have not yet been deleted will became visible again.
