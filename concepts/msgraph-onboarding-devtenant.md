# Set up a demo dev tenant for developing education solutions

A Demo EDU dev tenant is meant to simulate a Microsoft 365 EDU customer tenant for the purpose of developing and testing solutions.

With this tenant you can:

- Develop for the Microsoft 365 platform: Build rich solutions that integrate apps and business processes to enhance productivity in the modern workplace.
- Get a Teams development environment in seconds: Get a new instant sandbox with Teams sample data.
- Build apps for Microsoft Teams: Extend and customize Teams to create and connect apps and workflows.

## Create a new Demo EDU tenant for development purposes

To get an EDU tenant go to [Partner Sign Up](https://aka.ms/edupartnersignup) and click **Microsoft Education Integration**.

1. Complete all the sections of the form. Pay special attention to the **Product Information** section. You must provide your MPN ID in the **MPN No** field, and choose **Yes** in the **Are you requesting an EDU development tenant?** box.

    If you still don't have your MPN ID then join the [Microsoft Partner Network](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-mpn) before to continue.

1. After you provide all the required information, click **Submit**.

You must receive an email notification about you tenant request.
