# Get Microsoft Teams applications content within assignments

The education tech community has a rich set of tools and applications that are used in education, you can integrate your tool to be added to assignments as a resource for teachers and students to use.  

> **Note:** You can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) to test the APIs mentioned in this article.

## Creating a Microsoft Teams application

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps that are provided by Microsoft or external services. The apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions or resources.

You can see more detailed information on [how to create apps in Teams].(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/create-new-project?pivots=visual-studio-code).

This [application sample](https://github.com/microsoft/edu-assignments-apps-sample) demonstrates some best practices for Teams Apps integrated with assignments.

## Requirements

In addition to being a Teams App, **assignments** does have a set of additional requirements to be used within Assignments. See [the assignments requirements](https://aka.ms/AssignmentsRequirements) for using Teams Apps in Assignments.

## Enabling Microsoft Teams application

After you have created and published your app for Assignments, Teams needs to enable the app for the Assignment App. Fill out this [form](https://aka.ms/AssignmentsAppRequest) to get your app enabled.

## Launch the application

Your Teams app can be added as an **assignment** resource.

1. Get the application `id` using this endpoint and don't supply a request body for this method.

```http
GET /appCatalogs/teamsApps?$filter=displayName eq 'APPLICATION NAME'
```

2. Attach the Teams App to an assignment

#### Request
The following is an example of the request. Use the `id` from the previous request and set into `appId` property below.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/education/classes/72a7baec-c3e9-4213-a850-f62de0adad5f/assignments/1618dfb0-3ff2-4edf-8d5c-b8f81df00e80/resources

                "displayName": null
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3. The Teams App is now added into the assignment and available to launch by students.

See [other example](/graph/api/educationassignment-post-resources#example-7-create-an-educationteamsappresource) on how to create and attach the Teams app into an assignment.

## Permissions

Assignments API supports both delegated (per user) and AppOnly (per App) permission. For ease of use for the student and teacher Apponly is preferred as this allows for only approval of your app to retrieve data.
