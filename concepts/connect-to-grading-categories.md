# Grading Categories
This article provides guidance on setting up and using the grading categories for a class.

Teachers can use grading categories to weight assignments in the class grade. For example, a class could have 60% of its grade come from homework assignments and 40% from test assignments.

Assignments contribute to a grade based on their point values and the weight assigned to the grading category. For example, in a class with two assignments in a grading category that represents 50% of the grade, if the first assignment has 10 points, and the second has 40 points, the assignments contribute 5% and 20% to the total grade.

Grading categories are defined in the settings of a class. Every assignment that contributes to the final average grade must have a grading category applied. The weights of the grading categories for a class must add up to 100 during create, update, or delete operations. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) to test the APIs mentioned in this article.

## Get a class

A class is a group of students and teachers who share assignments and feedback. You get the list of classes from your education tenant. Then, you can locate the class where you want to set grading categories on assignments.

To get a list of the classes in your tenant, see [List classes](/graph/api/educationclass-list).

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/education/classes
```

## Get assignment settings

To create and manage assignments, you need to set up grading categories. You can get all the assignment settings in a class. Then, you can inspect them to see which ones need grading categories.

- [Get assignment settings](/graph/api/educationassignmentsettings-get): Gets the assignment settings for a class.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/education/classes/{id}/assignmentSettings
```

## Create grading categories

Grading categories are used to weight assignments in the final class grade. This section shows how to create grading categories for your class.

- [Add gradingCategory](/graph/api/educationassignment-post-gradingcategory): Gives an assignment a grading category, causing it to contribute to the class average grade as part of that grading category.

```http
PUT /education/classes/{classId}/assignments/{assignmentId}/gradingCategory/$ref
```
