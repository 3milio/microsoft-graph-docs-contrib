# Microsoft Graph connectors experiences

Microsoft Graph connectors offer an intuitive way to bring content from external services into Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft Search index, which enables external data to be discoverable across a set of Microsoft 365 experiences.

This article explains the experiences configurable with Graph connectors and the requirements to enable them.

The prerequisitie to enable any of these experiences is to have a basic Graph connector built. See [Work with the Microsoft Graph connectors API](connecting-external-content-connectors-api-overview) to learn how to create a connection, register your schema, and ingest items with correct access control. 

## Microsoft Search 
[Microsoft Search](microsoftsearch/connectors-overview) with Graph connectors allows your third-party data to be searchable for users in several Microsoft Search endpoints including Office.com, Bing at Work, and SharePoint. 

To congifure your connector for Microsoft Search, you must:
- add "search" as an experience in enabledContentExperiences in connectionSettings
- schema labels, properties, search attributes 
- enable vertical in admin center 

## Context IQ in Outlook Web
[Context IQ in Outlook Web](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-editor-using-context-iq-in-outlook-on-the-web-and-word/ba-p/3643497) with Graph connectors allows users to find in-content suggestions from third-party data while composing emails in Outlook web. Editor using Context IQ will surface relevant people, files, and Graph connector content, that users can select and embed as an adaptive card within the email.

To configure your connector for Context IQ, you must:
- add "search" as an experience in enabledContentExperiences in connectionSettings
- assign the following labels to your schema 
- send activities on item
- register urltoitemresolver in activity settings 

## Copilot (coming soon)
[Copilot](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/) with Graph connectors allows users to discover, summarize, and do Q&A on 

>![NOTE]
>Microsoft Graph connectors with Microsoft 365 Copilot is in early access preview. When you get access to the [developer preview program](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR06na7ADVcFBoFXEJ5M8YD1UNkdQODE5VDNKOUQ2UlBSVUJJRlJDVktTVS4u), you'll receive instructions on how to test your Graph connector with Microsoft 365 Copilot.
>Also, only customers who are part of the [Copilot Early Access Program](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/05/09/introducing-the-microsoft-365-copilot-early-access-program-and-2023-microsoft-work-trend-index/) will have Copilot enabled in their tenants in the coming months.

To configure your connector for Copilot, you must:
- Include a `urlToItemResolver`. By including a `urlToItemResolver` in your connector’s [activity settings](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-connections), Copilot will become aware when users share URLs to your content with one another. When users share an item with one another, Copilot will boost its importance for including the item in its response.  
- Provide a rich human-readable name and detailed description when you [create the connection](/graph/api/externalconnectors-external-post-connections). This helps Copilot understand what the data source is, so it includes the data source in its response if it’s relevant.
- Apply [semantic labels](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-schema). Semantic labels help Copilot understand the semantic meaning of your schema. You must apply as many of them to your schema as applicable.
- Add [user activities](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalitem-addactivities). In addition to adding your content `externalItems` to the Microsoft Graph, your connector should also add user activities around you’re content. Supported activity types are shown [here](/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-externalactivity). Items that have more activities are boosted in their importance.
