# Microsoft Graph tutorials

Microsoft Graph tutorials are step-by-step training exercises that guide you through creating a basic application that accesses data via the Microsoft Graph. They are designed to be completed within 30 minutes (45 minutes including optional sections).

In these exercises, you will create a basic command-line application that has the following features.

- Enables user authentication
- Accesses the user's profile
- Lists the user's mailbox
- Sends an email from the user's mailbox
- Enables app-only authentication
- Lists users in Azure Active Directory

## Build your first app

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer to download a completed project, you can download from one of the following places.
>
> - [Microsoft Graph Quick Start](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/quick-start) automates registering an application for you and downloads the completed project already configured for user authentication.
> - Completed projects can be downloaded from their corresponding GitHub repositories. Instructions on registering an application and configuring the sample are located in each repository.
