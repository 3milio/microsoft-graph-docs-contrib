# Connecting with Assignments and Grades

In the last couple of years Teams Education has become an essential part of educators and students life. One core part of Teams Education is the Assignments and Grades applications, which is the central workflow used by Educators to assign, asses, grade and provide feedback to students around the world.

We have built a set of integration points for your use to customize and extend the experiences for educators, admin and students when work with Assignments and Grades, and this post will highlight areas that we currently support.

## Getting Started

Assignments and Grades is a Team Application that is available for all users of Teams EDU. For Partners that needs a demo / development tenant of Teams can follow the steps here to [Set up an EDU development environment](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-overview).

## What scenario do you want to support?

There are multiple ways for you to read and update data, and integrate your app with Assignments. Depending on your needs you can use one or more combinations of integration points and APIâ€™s to interact with Assigments.
