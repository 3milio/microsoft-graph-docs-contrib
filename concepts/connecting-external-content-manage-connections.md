# Create, update, and delete connections in Microsoft Graph

Connections from external services to the Microsoft Search service are represented by the [externalConnection](/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection) resource in Microsoft Graph.

The Microsoft Graph connectors platform offers an intuitive way to add your external data into Microsoft Graph. A connection is a logical container for your external data that an administrator can manage as a single unit.

After a connection has been created, you can add your content from any external data source such as an on-premises content source or an external SaaS service. You can only view and manage the connections that you [created](/graph/api/externalconnectors-external-post-connections) or were explicitly authorized to manage. A search admin can view and manage all the connections in the tenant from the Modern Admin Center.

You can model a connection any way you want, but creating one connection for every instance of your connector is the most common model. For example, each time that you [set up the Microsoft Windows file share connector](/en-us/microsoftsearch/configure-connector), a new connection is created. You can also create a single connection to add all items from your data source. For example, you can create a single connection to add all the tickets and incidents across multiple teams from your helpdesk system.

## States and operations

Your connection can exist in one of the following states.

| State             | Description                |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Draft**         | An empty connection is provisioned. The data source, schema, or any settings have not been configured yet. |
| **Ready**         | The connection is provisioned with registered schema and is ready for ingestion. |
| **Obsolete**      | This occurs when a dependent feature, such as an API, has been deprecated. Deleting the connection is the only valid operation. |
| **LimitExceeded** | If you reach the maximum limit of a single connection or the tenant level quota across all connections, you cannot add more items until you exit the state. |

The following table specifies which operations are available in each state.

| Operation         | Draft              | Ready              | Obsolete           | LimitExceeded      |

| Create item       | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :x:                |
| Read item         | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Update item       | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Delete item       | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: |

A connection allows your application to [define a schema](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalconnection-post-schema) for items that will be indexed, and it provides an endpoint for your service to add, update, or delete items from the index. 

The first step for an application to add items to the search index is to create a connection.

## Create a connection

Before an application can add items to the search index, it must create and configure a connection:

1. [Create a connection](/graph/api/externalconnectors-external-post-connections) with a unique ID, display name, and description.
1. [Register a schema](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalconnection-post-schema) to define the fields that will be included in the index.
   - For information about updating the schema for an existing connection, see [Schema update capabilities](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-schema#schema-update-capabilities).

## Enable content experiences
A Graph connector can be enabled to participate in other Microsoft 365 experiences beyond Microsoft Search.

This can be done by specifying one or more content experiences (search, compliance, etc.) which your connection will participate in.
The content experiences listed in the following table are currently supported. When calling the Graph API, reference this [flag enum description](/graph/api/resources/enums-externalconnectors).

| Content Experience Type Enum | Description |
|-|-|
| search | Enabling search allows your content to show up in Microsoft search results. These results are consistently formatted across different search canvases, like SharePoint and Microsoft Bing. |
| compliance | Enabling compliance allows your content to be visible to Microsoft Purview advanced eDiscovery solution. Refer to [Microsoft Purview solutions](/microsoft-365/compliance/ediscovery) to learn more about advanced eDiscovery solution & licensing requirements.|

If you already know which content experiences you want your connection to partipate in, set the `enabledContentExperiences` flag enum at the time of connection creation.

Otherwise, you can make changes to the enabled content experiences as shown in the following example.
```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/external/connections/contosohelpdesk
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"enabledContentExperiences": "search, compliance"
}
```

## Connection settings
You can supply the default settings for each of the enabled content experiences using connection settings. These settings would affect content experiences as long as they are enabled.

### Search settings
You can define how search results are displayed in the Microsoft Search results page by supplying the default result types for your content. A search result type is a rule that causes distinct kinds of search results to be displayed in different ways. It has one or more conditions and a result layout built using Adaptive Cards. The result layout would be used to render the search results when the associated conditions are met.

### Compliance settings
Similar to enterprise search settings, you need to define how advanced eDiscovery search results should be displayed by supplying result types for your content. This will enable the eDiscovery manager to visualize the content when reviewing the datasets. Hereâ€™s an example of eDiscovery search review result pertaining to an Azure DevOps item in eDiscovery:

![eDiscovery search review result example for AzureDevOps item.](./images/connectors-images/connecting-external-content-connection-settings-eDiscovery-result-example.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Adaptive Card format is used for rendering results in eDiscovery. Unlike for the search experience, the eDiscovery experience only supports Adaptive Card elements up to version 1.2.

Please ensure you select the 1.2 as the target version when configuring the eDiscovery result template in the [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/).

## Update a connection

To change the display name, description, or enabled content experiences of an existing connection, you can [update the connection](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalconnection-update).

## Delete a connection

To remove all items that were indexed via a connection, you can [delete a connection](/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection-delete).

## Next steps

- [Register the connection schema](connecting-external-content-manage-schema.md)
- [Review the Microsoft Graph connectors API reference](/graph/api/resources/indexing-api-overview)
- [Download the sample search connector from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-search-connector-sample)
