### Use SDKs
- The [Microsoft Graph Python SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python) is now generally available. You can now access the beta and v1.0 endpoints of Microsoft Graph, with a fluent experience, designed to facilitate discoverability with the best features of the Python language. With simplified initialization and authentication, you can start making requests to Microsoft Graph with just 5 lines of code. The SDK also offers a built-in Retry-Handler that understands `429`, `503`, and `504` status codes. To learn more about the new Python SDK, see [Introducing the Microsoft Graph Python SDK](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/introducing-the-microsoft-graph-python-sdk/).
- The [Microsoft Graph PHP SDK v2.0](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php) is now generally available. The Microsoft Graph PHP SDK 2.0.0 offers best-in-class features to improve developer efficiency and code quality. By solving cross-cutting concerns like authentication, retry, and batching, the SDK gives you time back to focus on the design and value of your application. To learn more about the new PHP SDK, see [Write high quality code with the new Microsoft Graph PHP SDK v2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/write-high-quality-code-with-the-microsoft-graph-php-sdk-v2/).
