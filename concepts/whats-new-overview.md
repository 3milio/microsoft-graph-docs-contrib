# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## September 2021: New and generally available

### Cloud communication | Online meetings
Use `OnlineMeetingArtifact.Read.All` as delegated or application permission to read artifacts of online meetings. See [online meetings permissions](permissions-reference.md#online-meetings-permissions) for more information.


### Workbooks and charts
Create table rows asynchronously. For better performance, a good practice to create multiple table rows is to batch them in one [create tableRow](/graph/api/table-post-rows) operation and carry out the operation asynchronously. Follow with the [GET workbookOperation](/graph/api/workbookoperation-get) operation and [tableRowOperationResult](/graph/api/workbook-tableRowOperationResult) function to get the new [workbookTableRow](/graph/api/resources/workbooktablerow) resource.


## September 2021: New in preview only

### Education
Support for adding assignments to only students' calendars if you use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header for operations on the [educationAssignment](/graph/api/resources/educationassignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [educationAssignmentDefaults](/graph/api/resources/educationassignmentdefaults?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.



## August 2021: New and generally available

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune monthly updates for the v1.0 version. Set the **Date** filter for August, 2021, and look for a section with this same heading.

### Devices and apps | Service health and communications
GA of the [service communications API](service-communications-concept-overview.md) in Microsoft Graph to access the health status and message center posts about Microsoft cloud services.

### Identity and access | Governance
Get a collection of access review scopes that is used to define reviewers and fallback reviewers for an [instance of access reviews](/graph/api/resources/accessReviewInstance).

## August 2021: New in preview only

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune monthly updates for the beta version. Set the **Date** filter for August, 2021, and look for a section with this same heading.

### Identity and access | Governance
- [Reprocess](/graph/api/accesspackageassignmentrequest-reprocess?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) an [access package assignment request](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to automatically retry a user's request for access to the package.
- [Reprocess](/graph/api/accesspackageassignment-reprocess?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) an [access package assignment](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to automatically re-evaluate and enforce a user's assignments.
- [Get a set of policy requirements](/graph/api/accesspackage-getapplicablepolicyrequirements?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to create an [assignment request for an access package](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentrequestrequirements?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Get a collection of [access review reviewer](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewreviewer?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resources that is used to define reviewers contacted for an [instance of access reviews](/graph/api/resources/accessReviewInstance?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Get or set the duration of inactivity that recommendations are configured from in the [schedule settings of an access review](/graph/api/resources/accessReviewScheduleSettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), by using the **recommendationLookBackDuration** property.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
- Organizations can use [policies to enforce best practices for apps using application authentication methods](/graph/api/resources/applicationauthmethodpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). Such policies can apply to [specific applications and service principals](/graph/api/resources/appmanagementpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), or to [all applications and service principals in a tenant](/resources/tenantappmanagementpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Support for paging on the **appRoleAssignments** navigation property for [users](/api/user-list-approleassignments?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [groups](/api/group-list-approleassignments?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and [service principals](/api/serviceprincipal-list-approleassignments?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).


## Want to stay in the loop?

Here are some ways we can engage:

- Are there scenarios you'd like Microsoft Graph to support? Suggest and vote for new features at [Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-developer-platform/idb-p/Microsoft365DeveloperPlatform/label-name/Microsoft%20Graph).
    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`). 
- Be an active member in the Microsoft Graph community! [Join](https://aka.ms/microsoftgraphcall) the monthly Microsoft Graph community call.
- Sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program), get a free Microsoft 365 subscription, and start developing!
