> [!NOTE]
> Profile card properties correspond to attributes in Microsoft Entra ID. Adding an attribute as a property to the profileCardProperties collection for an organization creates and maintains a copy of the attribute, and displays its value in users’ profile cards. Deleting a profile card property from the collection removes the attribute from display in users’ profile cards; that operation doesn’t delete the attribute from Microsoft Entra ID.
