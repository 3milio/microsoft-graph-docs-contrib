Prior to using Microsoft Graph Data Connect (Data Connect) for the first time, you need to configure your Microsoft 365 tenant. This involves turning on the service to approve data extraction requests.

## Enable Data Connect in your Microsoft 365 tenant

In this step, you'll enable the Microsoft Graph Data Connect service on your Microsoft 365 tenant.

1. Open a browser, go to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and sign in with your “admin” user. 

2. Select the **Settings > Org settings** menu item. You might have to click **Show all** before you're able to view **Settings**.

3. In the **Services** tab (which should be the default selection), select the **Microsoft Graph Data Connect** service.

4. Select the checkbox that says **Turn Microsoft Graph Data Connect on or off for your entire organization**  and click **Save**.
