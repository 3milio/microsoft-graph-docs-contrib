This step goes over how to set up your Azure Resources to be able to connect Micrsoft Data Connect to it. In this step, you can either choose Azure Synapse or Azure Data Factory to create a pipeline to extract the data from Microsoft 365 to the Azure Storage account using Microsoft Graph Data Connect.

We recommend using Azure Synapse since Synapse has more in-built capabilities for data processing.

## Setting up your Azure Resources

# [Create an Azure Synapse Pipeline](#tab/AzureSynapsePipeline)

1. Open a browser and go to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).

1. Sign in to the portal using an account with an **[Application Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)** or **[Application Developer](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-developer)** role. Please ensure you are using your "developer" login and your account has privileges to create Azure resources within your subscription.

1. On the left pane, select **Create a resource**.

1. Find the **Azure Synapse Analytics** resource type, input the following values, and select **Create**.
    - **Subscription:** Select your Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group:** Select the resource group you created previously **mgdc-app-resource**
    - **Region:** [Select an Azure region in the same region as your Microsoft 365 tenant](/graph/data-connect-datasets#regions).
    - **Workspace name:** m365tostorage
    - **Account name:** synapsedatalstorage
    - **File system name:** flsynapse

        ![Screenshot of the Azure Synapse Analytics page with fields shown with values input and Review and create highlighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-create.png)

        ![Screenshot of the Azure Synapse Analytics page with Create highlighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-workspace.png)

1. Select **Go to resource**, open the synapse workspace you've just created (for example, **m365tostorage**), and then select the **Open Synapse Studio** tile to launch the Azure Synapse workspace full-screen editor.

    ![Screenshot of the resource page with Open Synapse Studio highlighted](../concepts/images/azure-synapse-studio-tile.png)

1. By default, Azure Synapse Analytics will use an integration runtime that auto-resolves the region. We recommend for the context of this tutorial in the developer tenant, to use default auto-resolve.

    1. Switch to **Manage (toolbox icon) > Integration runtimes > New**.

    1. Select **Azure, Self-Hosted**, and choose **Continue**.

        ![Screenshot of the integration runtime setup with Azure, Self-Hosted highlighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-IR.png)

    1. For the network environment, select **Azure**, and then choose **Continue**.

        ![Screenshot of the Integration runtime setup with Azure selected for network environment and Continue highlighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-azure.png)

    1. Use the following details to complete the form on the final screen and then choose **Create**.
        - **Name**: Name of your integration runtime.
        - **Description**: Enter a description.
        - **Region**: Select the region that matches your Microsoft 365 region.

1. On the left pane, select **Integrate (tube icon)**.

1. To create a new pipeline, select the **Plus** icon, and then choose **Pipeline**.

![Screenshot of the Synapse Analytics Pipeline with Publish all](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-publishAll.png)

## Run the Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline

Now that you've created the pipeline, it's time to run it.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several minutes for the consent request to appear, and it is not uncommon for the entire process (start, requesting consent, and after approving the consent completing the pipeline run) to take over 40 minutes.

1. In the Azure Synapse Analytics designer, with the pipeline open, select **Add trigger > Trigger Now**, and then choose **OK**.

    ![Screenshot of the Activities pane with Add trigger highlighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-trigger.png)

1. After starting the job, from the sidebar menu, select **Monitor** to view the current running jobs.

1. On the left pane, select the **Pipeline runs** tab. In the **Pipeline name** column, select the pipeline to view the **Activity runs**. This pipeline will show as _In Progress_.

    ![Screenshot of the Pipeline runs page with Pipeline runs highlighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-pipeline-runs.png)

1. After you're in the **Activity runs** view, go to the _Activity runs_ section on the bottom side of the page.

1. Hover over the **Activity name** and select the goggles option. This will open the **Details** tab.

    ![Screenshot of the pipeline page with the bottom pane highlighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-activity-run.png)

1. In the **Details** screen, look for the status of the pipeline activity as highlighted in the following image.The status should progress through Initializing, Consent Pending, Extracting Data, Persisting Data and Succeeded â€“ no further action needed from you for this.  

    ![Screenshot of the Details page with ConsentPending hihglighted](../concepts/images/data-connect-synapse-accept-request.png)

1. At this point, the activity run is internally paused until someone manually approves the consent request, either via the Microsoft 365 admin center or via PowerShell.
